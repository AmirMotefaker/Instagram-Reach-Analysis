People using Instagram professionally are using it for promoting their business, building a portfolio, blogging, and creating various kinds of content. As Instagram is a popular application used by millions of people with different niches, Instagram keeps changing to make itself better for content creators and users. But as this keeps changing, it affects the reach of our posts which affects us in the long run. So if content creator wants to do well on Instagram in the long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in. \n\n- I have been researching Instagram reach for a long time. Every time I post on my Instagram account, I collect data about how successful the post is after a week. This helps to understand how the Instagram algorithm works. If you want to analyze the reach of your Instagram account, you have to collect your data manually because there are some APIs, but they don't work well. Therefore, it is better to collect your Instagram data manually.\n\n- If you want to learn how to analyze Instagram reach using Python, you can use the data I collected from my Instagram account. You can download the dataset I used to analyze Instagram reach [here](https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/archive.zip).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import PassiveAggressiveRegressor","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/instagram-data/Instagram data.csv\", encoding = 'latin1')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Whether the dataset contains null values or not","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = data.dropna()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Look at the insights of the columns to understand the data type of all the columns:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analyzing Instagram Reach\n\n- Let’s start with analyzing the reach of my Instagram posts. \n- I will first have a look at the distribution of impressions I have received from home.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.title(\"Distribution of Impressions From Home\")\n#sns.distplot(data['From Home'])\nsns.histplot(data['From Home'])\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Impression","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- The impressions I get from the home section on Instagram shows how much my posts reach my followers. \n\n- Looking at the impressions from home, I can say it’s hard to reach all my followers daily. \n\n- Now let’s have a look at the distribution of the impressions I received from hashtags:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.title(\"Distribution of Impressions From Hashtags\")\n#sns.distplot(data['From Hashtags'])\nsns.histplot(data['From Hashtags'])\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Hashtag","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Hashtags are tools we use to categorize our posts on Instagram so that we can reach more people based on the kind of content we are creating. \n\n- Looking at hashtag impressions shows that not all posts can be reached using hashtags, but many new users can be reached from hashtags. \n\n- Now let’s have a look at the distribution of impressions I have received from the explore section of Instagram:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.title(\"Distribution of Impressions From Explore\")\n#sns.distplot(data['From Explore'])\nsns.histplot(data['From Explore'])\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- The explore section of Instagram is the recommendation system of Instagram.
